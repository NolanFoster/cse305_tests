#Usage
##Currently only supports python and java.
Open hw3_test.py and update the path then run.

```
python3 hw3_test.py
```

Make sure hw3.py is in the python directory and tester.java and hw3.java(will later move to the java directory) are in
the same directory as h3_test.py.
All tests have Unix line endings. If you fail a test it will save the output of the
failed test or else it will delete it.
